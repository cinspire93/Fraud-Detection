# Fraud Detection Case Study

## Objective:
The objective of this case study is fraud detection for an online ticket sales company. We are given a relatively large dataset (100k+ rows and ~50 features). Due to the sensitive nature of the data, I cannot show snippets of it like I did the DotA 2 dataset. However, I hope that methodology can still reach through to you.
